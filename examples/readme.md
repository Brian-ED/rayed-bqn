# Directions
## Simple
If you're new to this library, and maybe even bqn, you can check out the simpler examples.

- 1_shapes, circleInsideSquares.bqn is very documented. DrawEllispe; not so much.
- 10_clipboard, very short and simple.

## simple but few comments
- 2_text
- 3_images
- 7_3dDrawing

## Semi-complicated
- 8_modifyTextures, modifying textures hasn't been made easy yet, it's a TODO.
- 9_repl, the repl has quite a lot of nice text handling and events.

## Complicated
- 4_snakeGame, I intentionally experiemnted with syntax here.
- 5_arcGame, i just wanted to make a more complicated game. Details in the readme in the folder.
- 6_shader, implementing shader is a bit of work and a lot of pointers.

# Examples that could be added
These are tests and examples that I want to make into examples in rayed-bqn.
Most are in C and just need translation.
