# _colored_ would be similar to draw._with c.black,
# where there would be stored state that would be reverted when 𝕗 is done.
# _at_ changes relative position,
# while _colored_ changes either just simply color, or relative color?

# Could also be formatted like this, though related words are spread appart like draw.Text and text.
