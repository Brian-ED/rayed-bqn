# Rayed BQN
Rayed BQN is a library made to write windowed applications using the [BQN programming language](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/).
It inter-ops with [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib), but changes a lot of the functions to be more in-lined with BQN's syntax.

Breaking changes to any feature in raylib.bqn should be expected for now, as this library is very young and experimental. 
rayffi.bqn is only for bindings and is autogenerated with the currently installed raylib version so you can rely on these.

# Getting started

## Windows


First, clone rayed-bqn
```SH
git clone https://github.com/Brian-ED/rayed-bqn.git
cd rayed-bqn
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd ..
```

second download [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases/) with release `raylib-VERSION_win64_msvc16` (replace `VERSION` with whichever is latest, it should be most stable) and place it inside this project, at the same level as tests, rayffi.bqn and raylib.bqn and rename the raylib folder to "raylib".

## Linux

First, clone rayed-bqn
```SH
git clone https://github.com/Brian-ED/rayed-bqn.git
cd rayed-bqn
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd ..
```

Next, Build [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/) and install it:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/raysan5/raylib.git
cd raylib/src
make RAYLIB_LIBTYPE=SHARED
sudo make install RAYLIB_LIBTYPE=SHARED
cd ../../
```

Now run an example, if it doesn't work please post an issue.

## Mac
First, clone rayed-bqn
```SH
git clone https://github.com/Brian-ED/rayed-bqn.git
cd rayed-bqn
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd ..
```
### With Homebrew
Next, install [raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/). If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):
```SH
brew install raylib
```
Now run an example, if it doesn't work please post an issue.

### Without Homebrew
If you don't use homebrew you can get raylib by downloading the macos [Raylib release](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/releases/) with release `raylib-VERSION_macos.tar.gz` (replace `VERSION` with whichever is latest, it should be most stable) and place it inside this project, at the same level as tests, rayffi.bqn and raylib.bqn and rename the unarchived `raylib-VERSION_macos.tar.gz` folder to "raylib".

Now run an example, if it doesn't work please post an issue.

# Tested Raylib versions:

## Windows

"raylib-4.5.0_win64_mingw-w64" on Windows 10

## Linux

Raylib version 4.5.0 built from source on Pop!_OS.
Raylib version 4.5.0 built from source on Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS.
Raylib version 5.0.0 built from source on Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS.

## Mac

Raylib version 5.0.0 via homebrew

# Extra info

## config file

A config file named "config.bqn" will be generated at `./rayed-bqn/config.bqn`. It's a namespace bqn file with exported variables as settings.

For example setting the binary, the binary being one of the following: raylib.dll, libraylib.so, etc.
```bqn
raylibLibPath ⇐ "raylib/lib/raylib.dll"
raylibHeaderPath ⇐ "raylib/include/raylib.h"
```

```bqn
raylibLibPath ⇐ "raylib/lib/libraylib.so"
raylibHeaderPath ⇐ "raylib/include/raylib.h"
```

"/usr/local"The most important file in ./raylib/lib/ is the binary file, which could be located at:
windows: raylib/lib/raylib.dll
linux: /usr/local/lib/libraylib.so"
macOS: /usr/local/lib/libraylib.dylib

# Ideologies

Having as little magic as possible, magic meaning magic numbers and global values (available to the user) changing outside user's control.

Mutations localized in namespaces like "clock" are fine.

# Contributing

If you have any questions on contributing to this project, feel free to mention me on the bqn forum that's mentioned on the [bqn-wiki](https://mlochbaum.github.io/BQN/index.html#where-can-i-find-bqn-users), my username is Brian E.

You can submit however many issues as you'd like, I see them as a TODO list.

You can make pull requests and submit them for merges if you'd like, though be sure to discuss with me for any features you add to make sure you didn't put in wasted effort, though if it's mentioned in a github-issue and isn't taken do make sure you say you're working on it. Also say when you've stopped working on it, and share the roadblocks and progress, so someone can continue where you left off.

# Credits

Lots of thanks to [@dzaima](https://github.com/dzaima) for helping with FFI.

I owe credit to [@nulldatamap](https://gist.github.com/nulldatamap) for showing a lovely [example](https://gist.github.com/nulldatamap/30b10389bf91d6f25bb262da9c9e9709) to get me started with using FFI for BQN, and for making it easy to start with making this library.
